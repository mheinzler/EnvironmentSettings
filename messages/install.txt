EnvironmentSettings
===
A plugin for **SublimeText 3** that allows to set environment variables in the .sublime-project file.

Variables set with **EnvironmentSettings** are available throughout Sublime. Builds, scripts, even other plugins can relay and use them.

For example I use it to...

  * set *PYTHONPATH* and have python run successfully scripts that use my custom tools, from within Sublime. [Anaconda](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Anaconda) picks up my *PYTHONPATH*  too and nicely present code completion on my custom code.
  
  * Set *PATH* to point to some custom tools, for example [FabricEngine](http://fabricengine.com/)'s KL and then have a custom build that can call `kl $file` and run kl code from within Sublime

  * Define all the possible custom environment variables that my project needs. (obviously!)

The very nice thing about **EnvironmentSettings** is that all the variables it sets are set per project. **EnvironmentSettings** can catch when a Sublime's project change and re-set the environment variables accordingly. Even more, if you have two or more Sublime's windows open at the same time, each time you get focus on one of them, **EnvironmentSettings** will run and re-set the variables. All this is completely transparent to the user.
